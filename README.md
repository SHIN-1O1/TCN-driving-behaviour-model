# Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) vs. Random Forest  

## Introduction  
Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) are deep learning architectures designed for sequential data processing. Unlike traditional recurrent models, TCNs use **1D dilated causal convolutions**, enabling them to capture long-range dependencies efficiently.  

This README provides an overview of TCN, its features, and a comparison with low-level models like Random Forest.

## What is a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN)?  
A **TCN** is a fully convolutional neural network designed for time-series and sequential data. It uses:  

- **Causal Convolutions**: Prevents future data leakage.  
- **Dilated Convolutions**: Captures long-range dependencies efficiently.  
- **Residual Connections**: Improves gradient flow and stability.  
- **Fully Convolutional Architecture**: Allows parallelization for faster training.

## Advantages of TCN Over Random Forest  

| Feature               | TCN                        | Random Forest (RF) |
|----------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|
| **Handles Sequential Data** | Designed for time-series and sequential tasks | Struggles with time dependencies |
| **Long-Term Dependencies** | Uses dilated convolutions to capture long-term trends | Doesn't inherently model time relationships |
| **Parallelizable** | Fully convolutional (efficient on GPUs) | Not parallelizable for time-series |
| **Memory Efficiency** | No need to store previous states like RNNs | Requires feature engineering for time-series |
| **Data Requirement** | Performs well on large datasets | Works better with structured tabular data |
| **Feature Engineering** | Learns representations automatically | Needs manual feature extraction for sequences |

### When to Use TCN Over Random Forest?  
- When working with **time-series** or **sequential data**.  
- When **long-term dependencies** are important.  
- When **computational efficiency** and **parallelization** are required.
